### Solution:


### Login to `servera`
```
ssh root@servera
```
### Let's add the group first.
```
groupadd admin
groupadd devops
```
### Create punit user.
```
[root@servera yum.repos.d]# useradd -G admin  -u 1234 -s /bin/bash -d /home/ocp-cluster punit
```

### Post checks for `punit` user.
```
[root@servera yum.repos.d]# cat /etc/passwd | grep punit
punit:x:1234:1234::/home/ocp-cluster:/bin/bash
[root@servera yum.repos.d]# cat /etc/group | grep punit
admin:x:1003:punit
punit:x:1234:
[root@servera yum.repos.d]#
```
# Question 2: You need to set the password should be expired after `17 days` on server `servera`.

### Solutions:

### All the password information is stored in the file `/etc/login.defs ` and you just need to modify the value to `PASS_MAX_DAYS  17`.

### Open the file
```
vi /etc/login.defs
```


### For your references.
```
student@workstation:~$ ssh student@servera

[student@servera ~]$ sudo -i
